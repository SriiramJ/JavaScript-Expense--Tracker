## Features

- Add new expenses with a description, amount, and date.
- Display a list of all expenses dynamically.
- Calculate and display the total expenses.
- Edit or delete individual expenses.
- Persistent data storage using localStorage for seamless usage across sessions.

- **JavaScript**: For implementing functionality such as adding, editing, deleting expenses, and managing localStorage.

## How It Works

1. **Add Expenses**:  
   Users can enter the expense description, amount, and date to add a new expense to the tracker.

2. **List of Expenses**:  
   All expenses are displayed dynamically, showing their details.

3. **Edit/Delete Expenses**:  
   - Users can edit expense details directly.  
   - Expenses can be removed individually.  

4. **Total Expense Calculation**:  
   The total of all recorded expenses is calculated and displayed in real-time.

5. **Persistent Storage**:  
   All data is saved in localStorage to ensure expenses remain visible even after refreshing or closing the browser.
